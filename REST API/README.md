# Sample JavaScripts to call SharePoint REST APIs !
jQuery is required for these sample codes.

**Add below code in ASPX page (If no master-page is present) to enable working of SharePoint REST API**

`<form runat="server" style="display:none"><SharePoint:FormDigest ID="FormDigest1" runat="server"></SharePoint:FormDigest></form>`

*Rest calls from same domain. I will update code samples from cross domain calls later.
